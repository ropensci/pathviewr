`pathviewR` offers tools to import, clean, and visualize animal movement data
from motion capture systems such as 
[Optitrack's Motive](https://optitrack.com/software/motive/), the 
[Straw Lab's Flydra](https://github.com/strawlab/flydra), 
or other sources. We provide functions to remove artifacts, standardize
tunnel position and tunnel axes, select a region of interest, isolate specific
trajectories, fill gaps in trajectory data, and calculate 3D and per-axis
velocity. For experiments of visual guidance, we also provide functions that 
use animal position to estimate perception of visual stimuli.

## Installation

This package can be installed via:
``` r
#install.packages("devtools") # if devtools is not installed
devtools::install_github("vbaliga/pathviewR")
```

## Example

#### Data import and cleaning via `pathviewR`
We'll also load two `tidyverse` packages for wrangling & plotting.

```{r package_loading, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(pathviewR)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)

```

We will import and clean a sample data set from `.csv` files exported by
[Optitrack's Motive](https://optitrack.com/products/motive/) software. For
examples of how to import and clean other types of data, 
[see the data import and cleaning vignette](https://vbaliga.github.io/pathviewR/articles/data-import-cleaning.html).

```{r import_motive}
## Import the Motive example data included in 
## the package

motive_data <-
  read_motive_csv(
    system.file("extdata", "pathviewR_motive_example_data.csv",
                package = 'pathviewR')
  )

``` 

Several functions to clean and wrangle data are available, and we have a
suggested pipeline for how these steps should be handled. For this example, we
will use one of two "all-in-one" functions: `clean_viewr()`. 
[See the Data Import and Cleaning vignette](https://vbaliga.github.io/pathviewR/articles/data-import-cleaning.html)
for the full pipeline and the other "all-in-one" function.

```{r all_in_one, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, dpi=300}
motive_allinone <-
  motive_data %>%
  clean_viewr(
    relabel_viewr_axes = TRUE,
    gather_tunnel_data = TRUE,
    trim_tunnel_outliers = TRUE,
    standardization_option = "rotate_tunnel",
    select_x_percent = TRUE,
    desired_percent = 50,
    rename_viewr_characters = FALSE,
    separate_trajectories = TRUE,
    max_frame_gap = "autodetect",
    get_full_trajectories = TRUE,
    span = 0.95
  )

## Quick plot
## Colors correspond to unique trajectories (file_sub_traj)
motive_allinone %>%
  ggplot(aes(x = position_length, y = position_width, 
             fill = file_sub_traj)) +
  geom_point(pch = 21) +
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none"
  )
  
```

To get a sense of what we've done, compare the data before and after it has passed through the pipeline.

```{r compare_before_and_after}
## Check out the data's structure before cleaning and wrangling:
str(motive_data)

## Check out the data's structure after cleaning and wrangling:
str(motive_allinone)
```

An important aspect of how `pathviewR` defines trajectories is by managing gaps
in the data. 
[See the Managing Frame Gaps vignette](https://vbaliga.github.io/pathviewR/articles/managing-frame-gaps.html)
for more information on trajectory definition and frame gaps.

Now that the data is cleaned, `pathviewR` includes functions that estimate
visual perceptions based on the distance between the subject/observer and visual
stimuli on the walls of the experimental tunnel. For a complete description of
these functions, 
[see the Visual Perception Functions vignette](https://vbaliga.github.io/pathviewR/articles/visual-perception-functions.html).


#### Add more info about experiments
Now that our objects have been cleaned, we will use `insert_treatments()` to add
information about the experiments that are necessary for calculating visual
perceptions.

The data from this example were recorded in a V-shaped tunnel. Accordingly,
the vertex angle and vertex height of the tunnel, along with information about
the visual stimuli used during the experiment, will be added to the data
to inform calculations of visual perception (next section).

```{r insert_treats}
motive_V <- 
  motive_allinone %>% 
  insert_treatments(vertex_height = -0.3855,
                    vertex_angle = 45,
                    stim_param_pos = 0.1,
                    stim_param_neg = 0.2,
                    treatment = "latB")
```


#### Estimate perception of visual stimuli
To calculate the spatial frequency of the visual stimuli as perceived by the
subject some distance from the stimuli, we will use `calc_sf_V()`.

The resulting object contains 10 new variables which are values involved in 
the calculation of spatial frequency.

```{r calc_sf_V}
motive_V_sf <- 
  motive_V %>%
  calc_sf_V(simplify_output = FALSE)
```

To calculate an estimation of the visual angles perceived by the subject, we
will use `calc_vis_angle_V`.

The resulting object contains 12 new variables which are values involved in the
calculation of visual angles.

```{r calc_vis_angle_V}
motive_V_angle <- 
  motive_V %>% 
  calc_vis_angle_V(simplify_output=FALSE)
```

Visualizing the calculations provides an more intuitive understanding of how
these visual perceptions change as the subject moves throughout the tunnel.
Please [see the Visual Perception Functions vignette](https://vbaliga.github.io/pathviewR/articles/visual-perception-functions.html) 
for more examples of visualizing calculations.

```{r motive_V_sf_pos, fig.height=3, fig.width=6, dpi=300}
ggplot(motive_V_sf, aes(x = position_width, y = position_height)) +
  geom_point(aes(color = sf_pos), shape=1, size=3) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0,         # dimensions of the positive wall
                  y = -0.3855,
                  xend = 0.5869,
                  yend = 0.2014)) +
  geom_segment(aes(x = 0,         # dimensions of the negative wall
                   y = -0.3855,
                   xend = -0.5869,
                   yend = 0.2014)) +
  coord_fixed() +
  theme_classic() +
  theme(
    legend.position = "none"
  )

```
