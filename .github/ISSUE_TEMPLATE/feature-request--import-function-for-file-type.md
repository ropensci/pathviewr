**Is your feature request related to a specific file type? Please describe.**
A clear and concise description of what the problem is. What is the file type and are the files created by a specific program or software suite?

**Can you provide an example file of the specified type?**
Data on public repositories are preferred. If that is not an option, please contact one of the `pathviewR` authors directly.

**Describe the solution you'd like**
A clear and concise description of what you want to happen when the data are imported from the file.

**Does `as_viewr()` not work?**
We are very happy to create new functions for additional file types, but we'd also like to know if our current workaround does not work for you. Please provide a description of whether `as_viewr()` can work or if it fails in this use case.

**Additional context**
Add any other context or screenshots about the feature request here.
