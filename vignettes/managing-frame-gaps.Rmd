## Defining trajectories with `pathviewr`
`pathviewr` defines trajectories as continuous movement from one side of a
region of interest to the other. Before trajectories can be defined, the region
of interest must be selected via `select_x_percent()` in addition to all the
previous steps of the data import and cleaning pipeline as described in 
[the Data Import and Cleaning vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/pathviewr/articles/data-import-cleaning.html).
We'll start with loading `pathviewr` and a few packages from the `tidyverse` and
importing our data.

```{r package_loading, message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
## If you do not already have pathviewr installed:
# install.packages("devtools")
# devtools::install_github("ropensci/pathviewr")

library(pathviewr)
library(ggplot2)
library(magrittr)

## Import the example Motive data included in 
## the package
motive_data <-
  read_motive_csv(
    system.file("extdata", "pathviewr_motive_example_data.csv",
                package = 'pathviewr')
  )
```

We'll quickly run through the cleanup pipeline using one of `pathviewr`'s
all-in-one cleaning functions as described in [the Data Import and Cleaning vignette](https://docs.ropensci.org/pathviewr/articles/data-import-cleaning.html).
Since trajectories are defined in the `separate_trajectories()` function, we'll
stop the all-in-one there by setting it and every step after it to `FALSE` so we
can take a closer look at how trajectories are defined. Since all steps are set
to `TRUE` by default, we don't actually need to list them in the function, just
those we want to switch to `FALSE` or those that require additional arguments.

```{r cleanup_data}
motive_cleaned <-
  motive_data %>%
  clean_viewr(
    desired_percent = 70,
    rename_viewr_characters = FALSE,
    separate_trajectories = FALSE,
    get_full_trajectories = FALSE
  )

## Quick plot
plot(motive_cleaned$position_length,
     motive_cleaned$position_width,
     asp = 1)
```

### Inspecting the data 
We've cleaned up our data and are ready to link individual data points into
continuous trajectories. Deciding exactly how to define a trajectory will depend
largely on the quality of data collected and the resolution required to answer a
given question about the data. If the data are fairly continuous and high
resolution is required, the default `max_frame_gap = 1` will not allow any frame
gaps--movement must be continuous.

```{r max_frame_gap_1}
motive_mfg1 <- 
  motive_cleaned %>% 
  separate_trajectories(
    max_frame_gap = 1
  )

## Quick plot
plot(motive_mfg1$position_length,
     motive_mfg1$position_width,
     asp = 1, col = as.factor(motive_mfg1$file_sub_traj))

## How many trajectories do we end up with?
length(unique(motive_mfg1$file_sub_traj))
```

Plotting each trajectory reveals that perhaps some trajectories that should be
continuous have been split into two or more separate trajectories because of a
dropped frame or two. This data may require relaxing the stringent no-frame-gaps
requirement in order to link data points that should go together into a single
trajectory. Let's try setting `max_frame_gap = 5`.

```{r max_frame_gap_5}
motive_mfg5 <- 
  motive_cleaned %>% 
  separate_trajectories(
    max_frame_gap = 5
  )

## Quick plot
plot(motive_mfg5$position_length,
     motive_mfg5$position_width,
     asp = 1, col = as.factor(motive_mfg5$file_sub_traj))

## How many trajectories do we end up with?
length(unique(motive_mfg5$file_sub_traj))
```

By increasing the allowable frame gap, more chunks of data have been linked into
trajectories and so our trajectory count has dropped from 335 to 224. Because it
is hard to see all the trajectories piled up on top of each other, let's go
ahead and run this through `get_full_trajectories()` to clean out bits of data
that do not span our region of interest. To inspect each trajectory
individually, we can then use the `plot_viewr_trajectories()` function to take a
closer look at the quality of each trajectory. This can be computationally
expensive depending on your data set.

```{r get_full_trajectories}
motive_mfg5_full <- 
  motive_mfg5 %>% 
  get_full_trajectories(
    span = .6
  )

## Quick plot
plot(motive_mfg5_full$position_length,
     motive_mfg5_full$position_width,
     asp = 1, col = as.factor(motive_mfg5_full$file_sub_traj))

## How many trajectories do we end up with?
length(unique(motive_mfg5_full$file_sub_traj))

## Plot each trajectory
plot_viewr_trajectories(motive_mfg5_full,
                        plot_axes = c("length", "width"),
                        multi_plot = TRUE)
```

### Visualize frame gap choice 

`pathviewr` has several tools to help users decide what frame gap allowances may
be appropriate depending on their data and resolution needs.
`visualize_frame_gap_choice()` runs the `separate_trajectories()` function over
the same data set as many times as the user would like via the `loop` argument,
each time with a different `max_frame_gap` allowance. Each loop represents an
increase in the max frame gap value of 1. For example the default of `loops =
20` will run `separate_trajectories()` over the data set 20 times, with an
increase in the `max_frame_gap` argument of 1 each time.

```{r visualize_frame_gap_choice}
motive_cleaned %>% 
  visualize_frame_gap_choice(
    loops = 20
  )
```

The output of `visualize_frame_gap_choice()` is a tibble and plot of the number
of trajectories after running `separate_trajectories()` with 
`max_frame_gap = 1`, `max_frame_gap = 2`, `max_frame_gap = 3`, etc. 
We can see that as the frame gap allowance increases, more bits of data are
being linked into continuous trajectories and thus the total number of
trajectories decreases. The vertical line on the plot indicates the "elbow" of
the plot or the point at which counts of trajectories appear to stabilize and
increases in the `max_frame_gap` allowance no longer effect the trajectory count
very much.

### Autodetect
Setting `max_frame_gap = "autodetect"` rather than a numeric value uses the
"elbow" of the plots from `visualize_frame_gap_choice()` to guesstimate the best
value(s) for `max_frame_gap`. 

**In addition to automatically selecting the `max_frame_gap` depending on the
data, `autodetect` does so on a per subject basis rather than applying the same
allowable frame gap to all data in the data set since frame gaps can vary
between subjects.** 

The cap on how high the
`max_frame_gap` can go is defined as a proportion of the capture frame rate and
set by the `frame_rate_proportion` argument, which defaults to `.10`.

```{r max_frame_gap_auto}
motive_auto <- 
  motive_cleaned %>% 
  separate_trajectories(
    max_frame_gap = "autodetect",
    frame_rate_proportion = 0.1,
    frame_gap_messaging = TRUE,
    frame_gap_plotting = TRUE
  )

## How many trajectories do we end up with?
length(unique(motive_auto$file_sub_traj))
```

Our sample data has 3 subjects so with `frame_gap_messaging = TRUE`, the
`max_frame_gap` for each subject will be reported (the default is `FALSE`).
`frame_gap_plotting = TRUE` will display the elbow plots for each subject, but
also defaults to `FALSE`.
